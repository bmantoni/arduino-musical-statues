# Overview

This is a game for kids that plays music, randomly stops it, and watches for motion. If anyone moves, they lose.<br>
Pre-load your kids' favourite songs as MP3s into the SD card that goes into the DFPlayer module.<br>
I packaged it all up into a custom plexiglass enclosure with an included battery power supply, with some buttons and switches on the outside for power-on/off and continuing to play.
